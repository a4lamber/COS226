# Algorithms from Princeton University

This repository contains the code and notes for the algorithms course offered by Princeton University on Coursera. The course covers a wide range of topics related to algorithms and data structures, including sorting algorithms, graph algorithms, and string algorithms.

## Getting Started

To use the code in this repository, you will need to have Java installed on your computer. You can download Java from the [official website](https://www.java.com/en/download/).

## Course Overview

The course consists of several modules, each covering a different topic related to algorithms. The modules are:

- Week 1: Union-Find
- Week 2: Analysis of Algorithms
- Week 3: Stacks and Queues
- Week 4: Elementary Sorts
- Week 5: Mergesort
- Week 6: Quicksort
- Week 7: Priority Queues and Heapsort
- Week 8: Symbol Tables
- Week 9: Balanced Search Trees
- Week 10: Hash Tables
- Week 11: Graphs
- Week 12: Shortest Paths
- Week 13: Minimum Spanning Trees
- Week 14: Maximum Flow and Minimum Cut
- Week 15: String Sorts
- Week 16: Tries

Each module includes a set of lecture videos, readings, and programming assignments.

## Running the Code

The code for each week's programming assignment is located in a separate folder. To run the code, navigate to the appropriate folder and run the following command:

```
javac *.java
java Main

```

This will compile and run the Main class, which contains the code for the programming assignment.
